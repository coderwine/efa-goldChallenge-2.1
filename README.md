You will need to **FORK** this repository (repo) to your own account.  After you have forked it to your account, you will then need to **CLONE** that repo to your computer.  By doing this, you will be able to work through the challenges and push your code back to your own repo.  All instructions are within each file.  Below details the instructions for both challenges.

        - uses await to jsonify the response received from the fetch
        - console.log's the results of the fetch before console.logging a message saying 'this should print last'
